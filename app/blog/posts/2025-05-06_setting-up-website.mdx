## The decision to blog
I've always wanted to have a blog and describe things I am working on.
In the past this attempt failed often times, because I didn't really focused on the parts that really mattered by getting overwhelmed by thousands of options, and eventually not writing a single sentence of content.

## Provider versus VPS
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a great solution to host your own operating system online, yet to host a static website (that can be captured by a single code base) there are many plug-and-play solutions out there, making the hosting of a VPS unnecessarly much work.
Hosting a website myself on a VPS thereby as well failed a few times before, because it takes an unnecessary amount of (time) costs and maintainance just for an infrequent visitor.

## Website hosting choice
Companies offer free services to deploy a static website online.
First I considered [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which I think is a very popular choice among developers, but I had trouble finding a starting point in the code given the large amount of choices.
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) provided (a) clear and simple information on how deployment works, (b) provides [templates](https://vercel.com/new/jvtubs-projects/templates) to get started, (c) is free for personal use, and (d) allows to use a custom domain name.

## Deploying a blog template to Vercel
[Vercel blog template](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) installed with `pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog blog`.

The code itself can be launched by connecting a Github repository to the project.
The deployment flow is as following:
Local development -> Push to Github repository -> Fetched by Vercel that builds and deploys automatically.

### Bug on using the asynchronous dynamic API of Nextjs
On running an error occurs when opening a blog post:

```
Error: Route "/blog/[slug]" used `params.slug`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis

Reason is, as mentioned by the [nextjs webpage on dynamic APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis), we are incorrectly using `params` like a synchronous property.

Dynamic loading allows to leverage webpage parameters (e.g. the specific URL of the webpage we are visiting) to render a webpage with.
This feature can be really powerful when building a website rather than just a single page, because it gives the context to React components.
Since Nextjs v15 the usage of these webpage parameters are asynchronous, mentioned at the [nextjs webpage on dynamic APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis).

Solved by awaiting the params and using an async function.
``` javascript
export async function generateMetadata({ params: async_params }) {
    let params = await async_params;
    let post = getBlogPosts().find((post) => post.slug === params.slug)
    // ...
};
```


### Bug on using a deprecated version of React
Another error occurs when trying to load a blog post:
```
A React Element from an older version of React was rendered. This is not supported. It can happen if:
- Multiple copies of the "react" package is used.
- A library pre-bundled an old copy of "react" or "react/jsx-runtime".
- A compiler tries to "inline" JSX instead of using the runtime.
```

This is fixed by leveraging someone else their merge request [link](https://github.com/vercel/examples/pull/1122) (by kxzb-fun).
Afterwards it all works fine, and managed to push code and build on Vercel successfully.
